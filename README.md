# Introduction

While working as a linus sysAdmin i reasise Documentation is a big part of a sysAdmin's work so i started documenting things on paper and now on Github

***Why Github :- I like having it in a place that is easy to get to, but i also share it because i hope that someone else might be able to learn from it in the future.
